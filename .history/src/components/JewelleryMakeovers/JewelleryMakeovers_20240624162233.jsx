                    <p className='jewelleryMakeoversPolicyContent'> 
                        Considered the 'ideal' face shape, oval faces are well-proportioned with gently rounded features. They are widest at the cheekbones and taper
                        gradually towards the jawline, Oval faces are versatile and can carry various jewellery styles, including circular, hoop, or drop earrings, as well as
                        choker necklaces.
                    </p>

                        Characterized by defined angles at the corners, square faces boast a structured jawline. Drop earrings can create the illusion of added length,
