                        With wider cheekbones and soft contours, round faces are fuller than oval faces. Teardrop earrings and long necklaces can elongate the face,
                        enhancing its features.

                        Resembling a triangle, this face shape is elongated at the cheekbones and narrower at the jawline, Button-style jewellery and shorter necklaces are
                        well-suited for this shape.

                    <p className='jewelleryMakeoversPolicyContent'> 
                        Heart-shaped faces are broader at the temples and taper towards the chin, often accentuating defined cheekbones. Earrings with a wider base, such
                        as studs, button earrings, or inverted triangles, can balance the narrow chin and add a touch Of elegance.
