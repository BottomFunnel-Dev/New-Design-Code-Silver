 Pull your hair back and analyze your face in a mirror. Is it oval, square, round, triangular, heart-shaped, or diamond-shaped?
Oval: You're lucky! Oval faces can rock a variety of styles, from hoops to drops to chokers.
Square: Elongate your features with drop earrings.
Round: Teardrop earrings and long necklaces will add a lengthening effect.
Triangular: Opt for stud earrings and shorter necklaces to balance your features.
Heart: Wider-based earrings like studs or inverted triangles will flatter your chin.
Diamond: Dramatic pieces with cut crystals will complement your angles.
