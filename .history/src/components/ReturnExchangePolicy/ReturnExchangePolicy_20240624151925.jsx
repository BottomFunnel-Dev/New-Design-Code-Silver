                    Showroom purchases (Ships Faster): You have 7 days from the delivery date to return or exchange your item.
                    All other orders: You have 15 days from the delivery date to return or exchange your item.
                    What can I return or exchange?

                    Most unworn and undamaged jewelry is eligible for return or exchange.
                    You can exchange gold jewelry for its full invoice value within the policy timeframe (one-time exchange only).

                    What can't I return or exchange?

                    Certain items like gold coins, silver articles, silver rakhi, silver diamond bracelets, and customized/engraved jewelry are not eligible for refunds.
                    What if I receive a damaged or incorrect item?
