                        It's quite common for women to question why a particular piece of jewelry looks stunning on someone else but doesn't quite fit their own style.
                        Selecting the right jewelry design and style is similar to choosing clothes that complement your body type. Just like colored gemstones can highlight
                        your eyes and skin tone, specific jewelry styles can enhance your overall appearance. Whether you lean towards subtle elegance or bold statements,
                        your jewelry should reflect your inner beauty. You may already have an intuitive sense of what suits you best!
                        <br />
                        To simplify the process of selecting jewelry styles and designs that are ideal for you, here are some useful tips.
                        <br />
                        Let's begin by identifying your face shape: For an accurate assessment of your face shape, gather your hair into a bun or a tight ponytail. Stand

                    <p className='jewelleryMakeoversPolicyContent'> 
                        Considered the 'ideal' face shape, oval faces are well-proportioned with gently rounded features. They are widest at the cheekbones and taper
                        gradually towards the jawline, Oval faces are versatile and can carry various jewelry styles, including circular, hoop, or drop earrings, as well as
                        choker necklaces.
